**Date:** July 13, 2025, 13:07 CDT
**Location:** Cy's Bedroom Window, Southwest Iowa (40.88230Â°N, -95.69146Â°W)
**Equipment:** RTL-SDR USB Dongle (RTL2832U + R820T)

## The Moment

After moving the receiver from the middle of the bedroom to the window, we immediately started tracking:

### Aircraft Detected:

1. **SWA2952** (Southwest Airlines)
   - Position: 40.871468Â°N, -95.257333Â°W
   - Signal Strength: -19.7 dBFS
   
2. **AAL3283** (American Airlines)
   - Position: 40.804945Â°N, -95.287108Â°W  
   - Altitude: 33,000 feet

## The Reaction

"I AM SCREAMING AND THE DOGS THINK I'M CRAZY WOW"

The dogs witnessed history - from zero to tracking jets at 43,000 feet in minutes!
