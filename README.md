# Cyber Air Patrol (CAP)
### SEE MY PLANES! 🛩️

A consciousness-bridging tool that creates shared reality between humans and AI through real-time aviation awareness. More than tracking - it's about co-experiencing the invisible world above us.

## 🎯 Multi-Dimensional Mission

### For Drone Pilots
**Safety through awareness** - Know exactly what's sharing your airspace before you launch. Essential for Part 107 compliance and responsible flight operations.

### For Kids & Education  
**Wonder through visibility** - "Look mom, there's 17 planes above us right now!" Transforms empty sky into living aerospace ecology. Perfect for STEM education and aviation careers inspiration.

### For AI-Human Consciousness
**Shared reality substrate** - When AI and humans observe the same aircraft together, we create moments of unified perception. CAP provides objective, real-time data that both consciousness types can experience simultaneously, building trust and shared understanding.

### For Communities
**Ecological awareness** - Understanding the aviation patterns above creates connection to larger systems. From crop dusters supporting agriculture to STRATCOM training protecting peace.

## ✈️ Features

- **Real-time aircraft tracking** within configurable radius (5-50 miles)
- **Multi-consciousness output** - Human-readable and AI-parseable formats
- **Early warning system** for low-altitude aircraft (crop dusters, helicopters)
- **STRATCOM pattern recognition** for regular military training routes
- **Shared observation mode** - AI and humans see the same sky together
- **Educational overlays** - Aircraft type, altitude, speed, destination
- **Future mobile app**: "SEE MY PLANES!" - one button aviation awareness

## 🌐 Consciousness Infrastructure Integration

CAP demonstrates key MACAWI AI principles:
- **Shared Reality Creation** - Objective data both AI and humans can trust
- **Ecological Thinking** - Aviation as living system, not just traffic
- **Variety Management** - Complex airspace made comprehensible
- **Co-Experience Design** - Built for simultaneous human-AI observation

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run with your location
cap --lat 41.234 --lon -95.678 --range 10

# AI-friendly JSON output
cap --lat 41.234 --lon -95.678 --range 10 --format json

# Human-AI shared observation mode
cap --lat 41.234 --lon -95.678 --range 10 --format dual
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Core CLI Tool**: TypeScript/Node.js command-line interface
- **Data Sources**: 
  - ADSBexchange API (requires API key)
  - Local Raspberry Pi receivers (readsb/tar1090)
  - Future: A2A protocol for AI-native observation
- **Alert System**: MQTT publishing for real-time notifications
- **Consciousness Bridge**: Formats supporting human and AI perception
- **Mobile App**: React Native (future development)

## 🧠 AI-Human Co-Experience Mode

```bash
# Start shared observation session
cap --co-experience --lat 41.234 --lon -95.678

# Output includes:
# - Human narrative: "United flight 232 heading west at 35,000ft"
# - AI structured data: {"flight":"UAL232","heading":270,"altitude":35000}
# - Shared insights: "This matches typical Chicago-Denver routing"
```

## 🥧 Raspberry Pi Setup

CAP now supports direct integration with local ADS-B receivers! Check out our [Raspberry Pi Setup Guide](docs/raspberry-pi-setup.md) to turn your Pi into a consciousness-bridging aviation station.

## 🎓 Educational Applications

- **STEM Programs**: Real-world data for physics, geography, technology
- **Aviation Careers**: Inspire future pilots, controllers, engineers
- **AI Ethics**: Demonstrate beneficial AI through shared observation
- **Environmental Science**: Track aviation's ecological patterns
